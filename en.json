	"WhyAreThereTaxes": "Why are there taxes in the Pool?",
	"WhyAreThereTaxesAnswer1": "It would be impossible to sustain all the structures that make the Leaf Pool a reality: Servers, Bots, Human Resources, and many other running costs... We can't understand how there are pools with 0% tax from 0-day. Probably they have less orthodox means to obtain financing. Something you don't need to worry about on this Pool.",
	"WhyAreThereTaxesAnswer2": "Here, we try to make the Chia mining/farming process on the most transparent and safest experience possible for all our Farmers.",
	"WhatIsPPLNP": "What kind of payment system is PPLNS24/PPLNS+ and how does it work?",
	"WhatIsPPLNPAnswer1": "PPLNS means 'pay per last number of shares'. PPLNS24 is related to the last 24 hours while PPLNS is dynamic - since the last farmed block",
	"WhatIsPPLNPAnswer2": "Each 30 minutes our Distribution algorithm will run and distribute all farmed blocks not yet processed. If more than 24 hours have passed since the last farmed block, then all shares since that block will be counted. Otherwise the system will only count the last 24h.",
	"WhatIsPPLNPAnswer3": "When there is a distribution and you have valid shares for that round, you will be credited with your share on your pool account. Then, every hour, the system will check if there are any farmers that have reached the payout limit and transfer all the pending funds to them.",
	"WhatIsPPLNPAnswer4": "During the conversion of the funds in points for each farmer, sometimes there are a few mojo that are added to the pool tax.",

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a registered letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to R. S. Ciro 21, CV dta, 1200-830 Lisboa, Portugal. The arbitration will be conducted by the Centro de Arbitragem de Conflitos de Consumo de Lisboa (CACCL) under its rules, which are available at www.centroarbitragemlisboa.pt. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the CACCL rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $50 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.",
